    title: Peer Programming to increase "Team Quality"
    description: |
        Most engineering leaders are familiar with pair programming. You may already encourage it to foster learning in your team or as an alternative to ensuring code quality with pull-request reviews.
        
        This talk will show you the impact that collaboratively creating code has onÂ "team quality" rather than just "code quality" - creating opportunities to build trust, increase shared ownership, and define and better understand a shared vision.
    short: a talk on the positive effects that collaborative software development can have on the quality of your team, not just your code
