 title: Agile Retrospective Design Patterns
 description: |
    This talk will disappoint you with the fact that there is no such thing as a “standard retrospective” and that if you’re looking for reusable solutions to retrospectives, you’re trying to solve the wrong problem.

    We’ll dive into the importance of understanding the team and current situation, when deciding whether your next retro should be another “start/stop/continue, dot-vote, argue and forget” or a format tailored to your team’s situation.
 short: a talk/workshop on why there should be no such thing as a "standard" retrospective
