## Passions

<i class="fas fa-people-group"></i> Supporting People as a Lead and a Developer **I aim to have a positive impact**, on ...<br/>
... people figuring out what they want to achieve<br/>
... people and teams achieving their goals<br/>
... building environments enabling people to motivate themselves/supporting intrinsic motivation<br/>
... building innovative software that helps people in some way<br/>

<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> __Agile Software Development__<br/>
Getting to be a part of adopting and figuring out Agile at incubedIT and seeing it at scale at Dynatrace,<br/>
both general Agile principles and the practices of creating software that allows for being agile fascinate me.<br/>
Since 2021 I co-organize [Agile International Graz](https://www.meetup.com/agile-international-graz/) - an English-language Agile Meetup in Graz.
