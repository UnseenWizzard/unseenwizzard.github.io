## About

This page is here to tell you a bit about me and what I do. 

You can also [dowload my CV](assets/cv_nriedmann.pdf)!

#### <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> Aside from Software

While it's unsual as an Austrian, I haven't been skiing in years, but like to spend my spare time
hiking with my dog, kayaking, eating (and occassionally cooking) good food, driving old cars and recently writing tech articles. 

#### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>  Smart Systems

Iâ€™m deeply interested in classical and modern AI methods, and generally in
systems behaving intelligently. While I was able to spend some time on these topics working at incubedIT and in university, 
lately I've started making games to explore AI techniques.

#### <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Agile Software Development

Since taking part in adopting and figuring out Agile at a small startup, both general Agile principles and the practices of
creating software that allows for being agile fascinate me.

#### <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Education

Sharing knowledge has been a common theme in my professional life, starting from my civilian service, through my studies to my work and personal projects. 
Recently this finds its main expression in writing articles to share my knowledge and volunteering as a referre for [RoboCup Junior](https://junior.robocup.org/) Austria, a yearly robotics competition for school children.
