In late 2018 I started refactoring my Shadowrun Character Generator. Looking back at code you wrote years ago, can sometimes be shocking, and Iâ€™m not proud of showing off that old project. Splitting it into more logical modules, drasticly reducing the size of classes and code-duplication, as well as adding tests, is an on-and-off project.
