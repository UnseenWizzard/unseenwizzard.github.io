I fulfilled my mandatory civil service in a home for children from troubled families. Here I learned how much I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping someone learn new things, which made me decide to study to become a teacher of Computer Science and English. 

Realizing during my studies that being a teacher in the Austrian school system, where direction usually changes every election, is not something I want to spend my life on, I ended up going back to my original idea of just studying Computer Science after some years.
