Not a blog post, but here you find my thesis of extending a navigational map with semantic information.

Research, Design and Implementation of a Semantic Map for a long-term autonomous robotic system using ROS and OpenPRS (Procedural Reasoning).

You can read my thesis [here](/assets/Semantic_Map_Bachelorthesis_N_Riedmann_2016.pdf) and find the accompanying source code [on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/UnseenWizzard/lta_semantic_map/)
