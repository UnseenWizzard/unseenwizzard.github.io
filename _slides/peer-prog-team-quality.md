## Common reasons

**learning/knowledge sharing**
**code quality**

<style scoped>

## Common criticism

**no proven benefits**
**inefficient**
**difficult for some people**

Pairing can be difficult...
**because it puts people in situations of vulnerability.**

# We share...

## our thought processes

## We gain a deeper understanding of each other

# Creates "collisions" between people

## 1:1 moments between people

<!-- Pair programming creates 1:1 moments between team members that might not connect in a remote/hybrid setting.  -->

# Mobbing your shared vision

---

## whole group creative process
<!-- Whole group creative process strenghtens shared vision about how code should look and be created. -->

---

## strengthens shared vision about how we work

---

## work agreements, code standards, ...

## can emerge organically

<!-- Work agreements, code standards, etc. can emerge organically.  -->

---

## create moments to refine what the whole team values
<!-- Both mob programming and mob review can create moments to refine what the whole team values. -->

## Look into techniques!

## Pair promiscuously

## Start short, take breaks

## Keep going!
