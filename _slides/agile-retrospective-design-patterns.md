### consider which <br/> _"common problem"_ you're solving

---


_"common problem"_

## team

---

_"common problem"_

## team

## situation

---

## No reusable solutions 
## to uncommon problems :unamused: 

---

## But sometimes teams are in common situations

---

# Activity! 

Let's come up with Retros for these situations

--- 

> A new team just formed from members of exisiting teams, most don't know each other, some have bad opinions of other teams from the past
<br/>

> A long runnnig team that get's along well had an unusually successful sprint

What I would do: 
1: 
- needs a check in, set the mood for personal discussion. Something setting communication rules (e.g. Focus On/Off)
- Sailboat or good and bad future oriented format
- 5 whys in subgroups to get to reasons, possibly with dot voting before if too many topics
- Circle of Questions - going in a circle ask a question, next person ansers, then asks a question; to decide on ONE action and allow discussion on what and why of the action
- Appreciations: Give room for telling other team members something you appreciated them do in the retro or iteration, no one has to speak. 
Why? New team, with some previous bad opions, I'd want to focus the retro on conversation giving room for people voicing their thoughts and opinions. Sailboat helps discuss the outlook for the future and possible worries, then allows discussion of how to overcome the bad, or make sure the good happens. 
End on positive personal closing activity. 
Likley takes 1.5h!

2.
- likely doesn't need a check in, maybe just a quick "Describe your current mood in one word"
- Reflect on every story in the sprint - did it go well or not, Why? 
- "If we had ruined the last sprint what would we have done?" - collect the "Bad Sprint" on one board, then collect the opposite of this on another (https://retromat.org/en/?id=74)
- Now that we should have a decent idea of how a "good" sprint happens, decide on one SMART goal that helps make the next sprint good. 
- likely doesn't need a closing - good moment to gather feedback on the retro, e.g. 5-finger voting from 'waste of team' to 'super helpful'

Why? Team is mature and performing, so focus on 'how we can we keep doing great' without too much format
