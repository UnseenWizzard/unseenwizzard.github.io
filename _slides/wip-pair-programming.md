# Wait... what's "peer programming"? 

---

**Pair Programming**

**Mob Programming**

#### Collaborative development work!

Is your team **frequently doing it**?

# Why are we doing this?

---

## Common reasons

* learning/knowledge sharing
* code quality

---

## Common criticism

* no proven benefits
* inefficient
* difficult for some people

---

Pairing can be difficult...
**because it puts people in situations of vulnerability.** 

---

# Why should we be doing this?

---

# "team quality"!

(duh... that's the title)

---

# Trust

---

# Shared vision

---

# Shared ownership

# How does peer progamming help with that?

---

Requires sharing unpolished work and thought processes with someone.

---

Ensures feedback is given as early as possible rather than when **your work** is "done".

---

Puts you in collaboration - solving a problem together.

Rather than opposition - ciritquing your peers work.

---

Close and frequent collaboration results in deeper understaning of how your colleagues thing and approach problems. 

---

Creates "collisions" between people

---

Pair programming creates 1:1 moments between team members that might not connect in a remote/hybrid setting. 

---

<!-- _class: invert -->
Mob sessions for shared vision

---

Whole group creative process strenghtens shared vision about how code should look and be created.

---

Work agreements, code standards, etc. can emerge organically. 

---

Both mob programming and mob review can create moments to refine what the whole team values.
