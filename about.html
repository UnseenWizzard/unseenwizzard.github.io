## About

This page is here to tell you a bit about me and what I do. You can also [dowload my CV](assets/cv_nriedmann.pdf)!

#### <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> I'm a Software Engineer from Austria. 

While it's unsual as an Austrian, I haven't been skiing in years, but like to spend my spare time on
hiking with my dog, kayaking, eating (and occassionally cooking) good food, old cars and recently writing tech articles. 

#### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>  Smart Systems

I’m deeply interested in classical and modern AI methods, and generally in
systems behaving intelligently. While I could spend some time on these topics working at incubedIT and in university, 
lately I've started making games to explore AI techniques.

#### <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Agile Software Development

Since getting to be a part of adopting and figuring out Agile at a small startup, both general Agile principles and the practices of
creating software that allows for being agile fascinate me.

#### <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Education

Sharing knowledge has been a common theme, starting from my civilian service, through my studies to my work and personal projects. 
Recently this finds it main expression in writing articles to share my knowledge and volunteering as a referre for [RoboCup Junior](https://junior.robocup.org/) Austria, a yearly robotics competition for school children.
